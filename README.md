# Data Deposit Package Workflow

------------

This repo does contain documents, which will help in the building of Data Deposit Packages (DDPs), i.e. sets of files which will be deposited for long term storage and retrieval to e.g. Zenodo.

The following documents are included, each in `.md`, `.html` and `.pdf` format:

## `README`
This file.

## `Checklist`
A checklist detailing all the steps to take and the requirements for the data to obtain a DDP of the required quality

## `index`
A file containing the information to accompany the DDP which describes the files in the DDP. The information in this document should be sufficient to understand the content and background of the DDP.
